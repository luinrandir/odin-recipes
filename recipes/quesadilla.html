    <p>The wonderful think about quesadillas is how simple and quick they are to make! Just follow the steps below!</p>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your pan of choice on medium heat.</li>
        <li>As the pan is preheating, prepare your quesadilla workstation. Have your tortillas near you and as well as your cheese.</li>
        <li>Once the pan is preheated place a tortilla on the pan for anywhere from 10-15 seconds on each side. This will warm up the torilla making it a little easier to work with.</li>
        <li>Take the tortilla off the pan and place it on the plate/cutting board for the cheese.</li>
        <li>Place the cheese on one half of the tortilla being careful not to overfill, but making sure there is enough. Then fold over the other side to make a half-circle.
            If you are feeling brave you can place the cheese while the tortilla is in the pan.
        </li>
        <li>Place the quesadilla back in the pan (if you took the tortilla out). Let it slowly warm through, melting the cheese.</li>
        <li>As the cheese is melting, check the bottom of the tortilla to see if it is a nice golden brown. Flip to otherside once golden brown.</li>
        <li>Let the otherside get golden brown as well and the chese melted.</li>
        <li>Place on a plate and serve!</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <p>Here are some tips to help you make your best quesadilla!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Try to watch how much cheese you put it the tortilla. The more you put, the longer it will take to melt and the more likely your tortilla will burn!</li>
        <li>Use a low flame! I know it might make more sense to use a higher flame, but you want to melt your cheese and toast your tortilla at the same time. Low flames help with this!</li>
        <li>Use a medium to large size pan to have more quesadillas warming up at the same time!</li>
        <li>Invest in a comal: a round flat griddle that is used a lot in mexican cooking.
