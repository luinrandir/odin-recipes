    <h4>An old reliable favorite! The sandwich is a staple of a quick and easy lunch!</h4>
    <p>It is hard to go wrong with a good old fashion sandwich. The king of the quick lunches! From simple ham, mayo, and cheese to the biggest stack
        of bread, meats, cheese, lettuce, and other toppings, the sandwich rules them all! Of course, everyone has their prefrence to their sandwich.
        For this recipe I will be going through my personal preference of a sandwich for lunch!

            mayo tastes the best!
